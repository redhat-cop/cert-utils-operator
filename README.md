# Cert-utils-operator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/redhat-cop/cert-utils-operator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/redhat-cop/cert-utils-operator) [![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/redhat-cop/cert-utils-operator/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/redhat-cop/cert-utils-operator)

Cert utils operator is a set of functionalities around certificates packaged in a [Kubernetes operator](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk).

Certificates are assumed to be available in a [secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) of type `kubernetes.io/tls` (other types of secrets are *ignored* by this operator).
By convention this type of secrets have three optional entries:

1. `tls.key`: the private key of the certificate.
2. `tls.crt`: the actual certificate.
3. `ca.crt`: the CA bundle that validates the certificate.

The functionalities are the following:

1. [Ability to populate route certificates](#Populating-route-certificates)
2. [Ability to create java keystore and truststore from the certificates](#Creating-java-keystore-and-truststore)
3. [Ability to show info regarding the certificates](#Showing-info-on-the-certificates)
4. [Ability to alert when a certificate is about to expire](#Alerting-when-a-certificate-is-about-to-expire)

All these feature are activated via opt-in annotations.

## Deploying the Operator

This is a cluster-level operator that you can deploy in any namespace, `cert-utils-operator` is recommended.

```shell
oc new-project cert-utils-operator
```

Deploy the cluster resources. Given that a number of elevated permissions are required to resources at a cluster scope the account you are currently logged in must have elevated rights.

```shell
oc apply -f deploy
```

## Populating route certificates

This feature works on [secure routes](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/networking/routes.html#secured-routes) with `edge` or `reencrypt` type of termination.

This feature is activated with the following annotation on a route: `cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/certs-from-secret: "<secret-name>"`.

The following fields of the route will be updated:

1. `key` with the content of `tls.key`.
2. `certificate` with the content of `tls.crt`.
3. `caCertificate` with the content of `ca.crt`.
4. `destinationCACertificate` with the content of `ca.crt`. Only for `reencrypt` routes, if the optional annotation: `cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/replace-dest-CA: "true"` is set.

## Creating java keystore and truststore

This feature is activated with the following annotation on a `kubernetes.io/tls` secret: `cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/generate-java-keystores: "true"`.

When this annotation is set two more entries are added to the secret:

1. `keystore.jks`: this Java keystore contains the `tls.crt` and `tls.key` certificate.
2. `trustsstore.jks`: this Java keystore contains the `ca.crt` certificate.

A such annotated secret looks like the following:

The default password for these keystores is `changeme`. The password can be changed by adding the following optional annotation: `cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/java-keystore-password: <password>`.

## Showing info on the certificates

This feature is activated with the following annotation on a `kubernetes.io/tls` secret: `cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/generate-cert-info: "true"`.

When this annotation is set two more entries are added to the secret:

1. `tls.crt.info`: this entries contains a textual representation of `tls.crt` the certificates in a similar notation to `openssl`.
2. `ca.crt.info`: this entries contains a textual representation of `ca.crt` the certificates in a similar notation to `openssl`.

A such annotated secret looks like the following:

![certinfo](media/cert-info.png)

## Alerting when a certificate is about to expire

This feature is activated with the following annotation on a `kubernetes.io/tls` secret: `cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/generate-cert-expiry-alert: "true"`.

When this annotation is set the secret will generate a Kubernetes `Warning` Event if the certificate is about to expire.

This feature is useful when the certificates are not renewed by an automatic system.

The timing of this alerting mechanism can be controller with the following annotations:

| Annotation  | Default  | Description  |
|:-|:-:|---|
| `cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/cert-expiry-check-frequency`  | 7 days  | with which frequency should the system check is a certificate is expiring  |
| `cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/cert-soon-to-expire-check-frequency`  | 1 hour  | with which frequency should the system check is a certificate is expired, once it's close to expiring  |
| `cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/cert-soon-to-expire-threshold`  | 90 days  | what is the interval of time below which we consider the certificate close to expiry  |

Here is an example of a certificate soon-to-expiry event:

## Local Development

Execute the following steps to develop the functionality locally. It is recommended that development be done using a cluster with `cluster-admin` permissions.

Clone the repository, then resolve all dependencies using `dep`:

```shell
dep ensure
```

Using the [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk), run the operator locally:

```shell
operator-sdk up local --namespace ""
```
